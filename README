runic32 - base32-like (RFC 4648) encoder with Anglo-Saxon runes as a base.

Practicality is at least questionable, as it encodes every five bytes into eight weird symbols, each of three octets long (UTF-8), thus puffing the result up to copious 24 bytes. But this result, while remaining pretty much useless, looks great. This deeply philosophical combination justifies the method. Of course one needs a compatible console to see it.

Golang:

go build runic32.go

Examples:

$ echo "ENCODE THIS STRING TO RUNIC-BASED STRING" | ./runic32

$ echo "ᚻᛝᚹᚱᚷᛗᛠᚱᚻᛚᛏᚳᚻᛖᚦᚾᛁᛇᛏᚳᚷᛝᚦᛖᚾᚳᚹᚱᛉᚻᚦᛚᚾᛣᛏᚳᚱᛝᛁᛉᚾᚳᚢᛖᛠᛏᛖᚢᛁᛈᚦᛚᚻᚻᚦᛗᛁᛒᚾᚱᛖᛗᛖᚹᚢᚻᛥᛥᛥᛥᛥᛥ" | ./runic32 -d

$ ./runic32 cert.der > cert.runic32
$ ./runic32 -d cert.runic32 > cert.der
